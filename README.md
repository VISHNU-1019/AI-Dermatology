# AI-Based Skin Disease Prediction System

**Description:**

This project is an AI-powered system for predicting skin diseases using deep learning models and image data. It can assist healthcare professionals and patients in early diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions.

**Algorithms Used:**

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are utilized for image classification tasks, and they are the backbone of the disease prediction model. These networks can automatically learn relevant features from the input images.

- **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning techniques are applied to leverage pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or Inception) on large image datasets. Fine-tuning is done to adapt these models to the specific skin disease classification task.

**Features:**

- Deep learning models for skin disease classification
- User-friendly web interface for image upload and prediction
- Detailed information about predicted skin diseases
